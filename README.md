# 🚀 MintoCoin – A Full-Stack Blockchain Application

Just launched **MintoCoin**, my first full-stack blockchain application!  
This project is a deep dive into how cryptocurrencies like **Bitcoin** work — built entirely from scratch using **JavaScript**, **Node.js**, and **Express**.

- ✅ **Secure Transactions**  
  Sign and verify transactions using private keys to ensure authenticity and prevent tampering.

- ⛏️ **Mining Mechanism**  
  Simulate a real-world miner: mine new blocks and receive automatic crypto rewards.

  A lightweight HTML/CSS/JavaScript interface for:
  - Sending coins
